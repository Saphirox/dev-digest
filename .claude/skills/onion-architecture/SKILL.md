description: "Onion Architecture for the DevDigest backend (server/ Fastify + Drizzle API, the reviewer-core engine, and the mcp/ stdio MCP server, which mirrors server/'s module layout): which ring a piece of code belongs to, which way imports may point, and how Fastify routes, services, Drizzle repositories, ports/adapters, the DI container and tests fit the rings. Use whenever you add or change backend code: a new module, route, service, repository, query, adapter, port, job handler, SSE stream, reviewer-core feature, or MCP tool/service in mcp/; when you decide where a backend function or file belongs; move logic out of a route; add a transaction; wire something into platform/container.ts; review a server PR for layering; or answer 'where should this go' on the backend. Trigger on routes.ts, tools.ts, service.ts, repository.ts, ports.ts, helpers.ts, container.db, container.ts, adapters/, drizzle in a route, port, adapter, dependency injection, layering, clean/hexagonal/onion architecture, dependency-cruiser, arch:check, even when the user doesn't say 'architecture'.

# Onion Architecture (backend)

Where backend code lives and which way it may depend. Scope: `server/`
(`@devdigest/api`), `reviewer-core/` (`@devdigest/reviewer-core`) and `mcp/`
(`@devdigest/mcp`). `mcp/` uses **the same module layout and rules** as
`server/`, with `tools.ts` in place of `routes.ts`; see `references/mcp-package.md`. This
skill covers placement and dependency direction. It doesn't cover how to use
Fastify or Drizzle.

**Sibling skills. Link to them, don't restate them:**
- `fastify-best-practices`: plugins, hooks, schemas, error handling mechanics.
- `drizzle-orm-patterns`: query syntax, relations, transactions API, migrations.
- `postgresql-table-design`: columns, indexes, constraints.
- `zod`: schema authoring, `safeParse`, inference.

**Reference files. Read only the one the task needs:**

| File | Read it when |
|---|---|
| [references/layers-and-dependency-rule.md](references/layers-and-dependency-rule.md) | You need the full ring → folder map, the import matrix, or the list of known debt |
| [references/fastify-presentation.md](references/fastify-presentation.md) | Writing or reviewing a `routes.ts`, error mapping, SSE, job-handler registration |
| [references/application-services.md](references/application-services.md) | Writing a service, executor or pipeline; service dependencies; transactions across repositories |
| [references/drizzle-infrastructure.md](references/drizzle-infrastructure.md) | Writing a repository, mapping rows to contracts, `tx`, translating Postgres errors |
| [references/ports-and-adapters.md](references/ports-and-adapters.md) | Adding an external system (LLM, GitHub, git, a parser), a new port, or wiring the DI container; anything in `reviewer-core` |
| [references/mcp-package.md](references/mcp-package.md) | Anything under `mcp/`: the folder → ring map mirroring `server/src`, import rules, MCP-specific presentation rules, and how `architecture.test.ts` enforces them |
| [references/testing-and-enforcement.md](references/testing-and-enforcement.md) | Choosing the test type per ring; running or changing `arch:check` (dependency-cruiser) |

Sources for every rule: [references.md](references.md).

## Step 0: The project's conventions win

1. Read `server/AGENTS.md` (and `reviewer-core/AGENTS.md` if you touch it).
2. Copy the shape of a **clean** module: `repos`, `agents` or `reviews`
   (`routes.ts` → `service.ts` → `repository.ts`, plus `helpers.ts` and `constants.ts`).
3. **Don't** copy `repo-intel` (its service and pipeline call
   `src/adapters/*` directly) or `reviews/run-executor.ts` /
   `reviews/diff-loader.ts` (they import `db/schema`). That is known debt, not a
   pattern (see the debt list in `references/layers-and-dependency-rule.md`).

Why: in Onion Architecture a rule that holds almost everywhere is worth
little. One route that "just queries the table" makes the next one look
normal. Match the clean modules, and name any debt you have to touch.

```

## Core principles

1. **Dependencies point inward, only.** Code may import from its own ring or
   any ring closer to the centre, never outward. A service never imports a
   route, a Drizzle table or `src/adapters/*`. A helper never imports anything
   with I/O. *(Palermo part 3: "Direction of coupling is toward the center.")*
2. **The database and every SDK are outside.** Postgres, Drizzle, Octokit,
   simple-git, the OpenAI/Anthropic SDKs, ast-grep and ripgrep are
   infrastructure. The core names what it needs as an **interface (port)**, and
   an adapter in the outer ring implements it. *(Palermo: "the database is not
   the center"; Cockburn, Ports & Adapters)*
3. **Interfaces belong to the ring that uses them.** A repository interface
   is declared next to the service that needs it (`modules/<f>/ports.ts`),
   not next to the Drizzle class. That is what lets the dependency point
   inward (dependency inversion). *(Palermo part 3: "Inner layers define
   interfaces. Outer layers implement interfaces.")*
4. **One composition root.** Only `platform/container.ts`, `app.ts` and each
   module's route plugin (the module's own wiring point) create concrete
   classes. Everything else receives dependencies.
5. **The core is testable without infrastructure.** If a unit test of a
   service or helper needs Docker, a network or a key, the layering is broken.
   The ring determines the test type (see `references/testing-and-enforcement.md`).
   *(Palermo part 3: "All application core code can be compiled and run
   separate from infrastructure.")*

## "Where does this go?"

```
Is it HTTP-specific (params, status codes, reply, SSE framing)?
  └─ yes → modules/<f>/routes.ts                      (presentation)
Does it talk to Postgres / Drizzle?
  └─ yes → modules/<f>/repository.ts or repository/*.repo.ts   (infrastructure)
Does it call an external system or native lib (GitHub, git, LLM, fs, ast-grep)?
  └─ yes → src/adapters/<port>/<impl>.ts behind an interface   (infrastructure)
Is it an interface the application needs from the outside world?
  └─ cross-module or shared with client → vendor/shared/adapters.ts (edit both copies)
     module-local (e.g. a repository contract) → modules/<f>/ports.ts
Does it orchestrate a use case (load → decide → persist → enqueue/publish)?
  └─ yes → modules/<f>/service.ts (or run-executor.ts / pipeline/*)   (application)
Is it a pure transform, rule or calculation with no I/O?
  └─ module-local → modules/<f>/helpers.ts; a literal → constants.ts   (domain)
     part of the review engine → reviewer-core/src/*                  (domain)
Is it a request/response/entity shape?
  └─ vendor/shared/contracts/* (zod + inferred type, same name)       (domain)
Does it construct concrete classes or pick an implementation?
  └─ platform/container.ts (shared) or the module's routes.ts plugin (module-local)
```

## Hard rules

Each rule is backed by `pnpm arch:check` (dependency-cruiser,
`server/.dependency-cruiser.cjs`). **error** rules fail the check. **warn**
rules are known debt that new code must not add to.

| Rule | Severity | What it forbids |
|---|---|---|
| `shared-contracts-pure` | error | `vendor/shared` importing anything but itself and `zod` |
| `reviewer-core-pure` | error | `reviewer-core` importing Fastify, Drizzle, Postgres, Octokit, simple-git or `server/src/*` |
| `reviewer-core-engine-no-sdk` | error | engine code outside `reviewer-core/src/llm/` importing the `openai` SDK or `OpenRouterProvider` |
| `no-cross-module-internals` | error | module A importing module B's `routes`/`service`/`repository`/`run-executor` |
| `platform-not-outward` | error | `platform/*` (except `container.ts`) importing `modules/*` |
| `not-to-unresolvable` | error | imports that don't resolve (typos, or a package the ring doesn't install) |
| `routes-no-persistence` | error | `routes.ts` importing `drizzle-orm` or `src/db/*` |
| `application-no-drizzle` | warn | non-repository module files importing `drizzle-orm` or `src/db/schema` |
| `modules-no-concrete-adapters` | warn | `modules/*` importing `src/adapters/*` |
| `adapters-not-inward-to-app` | warn | `adapters/*` importing `modules/*` or the composition root |
| `pure-module-files-no-io` | error | `helpers.ts`/`constants.ts` importing Fastify, Drizzle, `src/db`, adapters or the container |
| `no-circular` | warn | import cycles |

Run it: `cd server && ./node_modules/.bin/depcruise src ../reviewer-core/src --config .dependency-cruiser.cjs --output-type err`
(or `pnpm arch:check`, where the pnpm wrapper works; see the `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS`
entry in the root `INSIGHTS.md`). Baseline on 2026-10-03: **0 errors, 15 warnings**, all in `repo-intel` and `reviews/{run-executor,diff-loader}.ts`.
A change that raises the warning count adds debt, so fix it or justify it in the PR.

## Blind spots: what `arch:check` passes but is still wrong

dependency-cruiser only sees import edges that its rules name. A green
`arch:check` (or a green `mcp/test/architecture.test.ts`) proves those edges
are absent. It doesn't prove the change is layered right. When you review,
check these by reading the code, because no tool will:

| Not caught | Why the checker misses it | Look for |
|---|---|---|
| An npm SDK used in a module (`openai`, `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, `octokit`, `simple-git`, `@ast-grep/*`) | `modules-no-concrete-adapters` matches `src/adapters/*` only, not packages in `node_modules` | `import … from 'octokit'` (or another SDK) in `service.ts`/`routes.ts`; `new Octokit(`/`new OpenAI(` outside `src/adapters/` |
| HTTP types in the application ring | No rule forbids `fastify` imports from `service.ts` | `FastifyReply`/`FastifyRequest` in a service signature, `reply.code(…)` below a route |
| `process.env` in a module or `reviewer-core` | Not an import, so invisible to dependency-cruiser | `process.env.` under `src/modules/` or in `reviewer-core`. Config comes from `AppConfig`, secrets from `container.secrets`. Today only `platform/config.ts`, two adapters (`secrets/local.ts`, `git/simple-git.ts`) and the DB scripts read it |
| A rule weakened in the same PR | The checker obeys its own config | A diff to `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` (a new `pathNot`, a `severity` lowered to `warn`, a rule deleted) or to `mcp/test/architecture.test.ts`'s allowlists that exempts the PR's own files. Treat it as blocking: fix the code, don't exempt it. Only a deliberate, explained policy change (with the debt list updated) may touch the config |
| Unscoped queries, multi-write use cases without a transaction | Not an import question | Each repository `where` has `workspaceId`; two writes that must succeed together share one `db.transaction` |

## Deep trace: leaks that hide one hop away

The blind-spots table catches what sits *in* a file. The harder leaks sit
one file further away, behind a type alias or inside a callback, so a
line-by-line read of each file looks clean. For a new module, or any PR
whose CI is green, trace these three things before you sign off:

1. **Follow every import chain to the end.** A file is as impure as the most
   impure thing it reaches, directly or through a sibling. Start at each
   `helpers.ts`, `constants.ts` and `ports.ts` and follow the relative imports
   (`./calendar.ts`, `./format.ts`, …) all the way down. The `pure-module-files-no-io`
   rule only checks the *direct* imports of `helpers`/`constants`, and only
   for Fastify, Drizzle, `src/db`, adapters and the container. So
   `helpers.ts → ./calendar.ts → node:fs` passes. Domain code must not reach
   I/O builtins (`node:fs`, `node:child_process`, `node:net`, `node:http(s)`),
   global `fetch`, `process.env` or module-load side effects (a
   `readFileSync` at the top level). Pure builtins such as `node:path` and
   `node:url` are fine (`reviews/intent/helpers.ts` uses `node:path`). Fix: load
   the data in a repository or adapter and pass it into the helper as an argument.
2. **Read port and deps types as contracts.** Nothing in `ports.ts` or in a
   service's `…Deps` may name an infrastructure type: `Db`, `DbExecutor` or any
   alias built from them (`Parameters<Db['transaction']>…`), a Drizzle row type
   (`$inferSelect`, `InferSelectModel`), `FastifyRequest`/`FastifyReply`, or an
   SDK type. `application-no-drizzle` matches `src/db/schema` but **not**
   `src/db/client`, so `import type { Db, DbExecutor } from '../../db/client.js'`
   in a service or port passes `arch:check`. Today only repositories import it
   (`reviews/repository/*.repo.ts`, `repo-intel/repository.ts`). A service that
   calls `this.deps.db.transaction(…)` owns a Drizzle transaction. Fix: a
   `UnitOfWork` port (`references/application-services.md` §3), with the
   Drizzle side in the repository.
3. **List every `await` inside a transaction callback.** Only store writes,
   and the reads they depend on, belong there. A GitHub, LLM, git or `fetch`
   call inside `transaction(async (tx) => …)` (or `uow.run(…)`) holds the row
   locks and the pool connection for the whole network round trip, and it
   rolls back DB work for a network error. Fix: make the external call first,
   then open the transaction for the writes only.

Report a trace finding as the chain, with a `file:line` per hop, e.g.
`helpers.ts:2 → calendar.ts:1 → node:fs (readFileSync at calendar.ts:4)`, so
the author sees why a file that looks clean isn't.

## Reviewing a new module

A new feature module is a unit of review on its own. Before the per-line
findings, check that the module is wired in and covered by the enforcement:

1. **server/**: registered in `src/modules/index.ts` (one import + one entry).
   Otherwise none of its routes exist. dependency-cruiser picks it up by path
   with no config change. If the PR *does* change `.dependency-cruiser.cjs`,
   see the blind-spots row above.
2. **mcp/**: registered in `src/modules/index.ts` **and** added to
   `MODULE_NAMES` in `mcp/test/architecture.test.ts`. If it's missing,
   `resolveFile` throws for every file of the module and the whole
   architecture suite fails.
3. **Shape**: `routes.ts`/`tools.ts` → `service.ts` → `repository.ts` +
   `ports.ts`, and `helpers.ts`/`constants.ts` for pure code, like
   `conventions` (server) or `blast` (mcp).
4. **Imports**: list every `../<other-module>/` import in the new files.
   - server/: one to another module's `routes`/`service`/`repository`/`run-executor`
     is an error, and that includes taking a type from it. Pure `helpers`/`constants`
     and `ports` types are tolerated; the repo already does it, e.g.
     `brief/service.ts` → `blast/helpers.js`. Get a collaborator through your
     own `ports.ts`, built in your `routes.ts` plugin or taken from the container.
   - mcp/: any import of another module's file is an error. Shared code goes
     through `modules/_shared/`.
5. **Tests by ring**: a service test with a fake store and an `*.it.test.ts`
   for the repository (server), or `mcp/test/` service + repository tests.

## Anti-patterns → fix

| You see | Why it hurts | Do instead |
|---|---|---|
| `container.db.select()` / `import { eq } from 'drizzle-orm'` in `routes.ts` | Presentation depends on the DB. Can't test the route's logic without Postgres. Tenancy scoping gets re-implemented per route | Move the query to `repository.ts`, call it from a service, and keep the route at "validate → call → return" |
| Service does `new FooRepository(container.db)` and types the field as the class | Application depends on the concrete Drizzle class, so tests need a DB | Declare `FooStore` in `ports.ts`, type the dependency as `FooStore`, construct `FooRepository` in the module plugin or container |
| `import { parseSymbols } from '../../adapters/astgrep/index.js'` in a module | Application is welded to a native lib | Call it through a port on the container (`container.repoIntel`, a new port), or move a truly pure parser inward |
| `helpers.ts` imports `db/schema` to type a row | The "pure" file now drags in infrastructure types | The repository maps row → contract type, and helpers work on contract types only |
| Two repository writes that must succeed together, with no transaction | Partial writes on failure | A unit-of-work port in the service that runs both writes in one `db.transaction` (see `references/application-services.md`) |
| `throw reply.code(404)` / `reply` passed into a service | Application knows HTTP | Throw `NotFoundError` (and other `AppError`s). The shared error handler in `app.ts` maps it to a status |
| `process.env.X` read inside a service or `reviewer-core` | Hidden config and untestable branching | Use `AppConfig` from the container. `reviewer-core` receives values as parameters |
| New SDK client created inline in a service | No seam to mock, and credentials handling spreads | A port + an adapter + a container getter + a mock in `adapters/mocks.ts` |

## PR checklist (backend)

- [ ] Every new file sits in the ring the decision tree gives. Its imports point only inward.
- [ ] `routes.ts` has no `drizzle-orm`, `src/db/*` or `src/adapters/*` import. It validates with zod schemas, resolves the workspace with `getContext`, calls one service method and returns a contract type.
- [ ] Services depend on interfaces (`@devdigest/shared` ports, `ports.ts`), never on `src/adapters/*` or Drizzle.
- [ ] Every query lives in a repository and is scoped by `workspaceId`.
- [ ] Multi-write use cases run inside one transaction owned by the service.
- [ ] A new external dependency has a port, an adapter, a container getter, a `ContainerOverrides` field and a mock.
- [ ] `reviewer-core` stays pure: no DB, fs, GitHub, `process.env`. Only `src/llm/` touches an SDK.
- [ ] Tests match the ring: pure unit tests for domain and services (with fakes), `*.it.test.ts` for repositories.
- [ ] `arch:check`: 0 errors, and the warning count is not above the baseline.
- [ ] The blind spots above were checked by reading the code, not inferred from a green `arch:check`. No `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` or `architecture.test.ts` exemption for the PR's own files.
- [ ] Deep trace done: import chains from pure files followed to the end, no infrastructure type in `ports.ts`/service deps, no external call inside a transaction.
- [ ] A new module is registered (`modules/index.ts`; for `mcp/` also `MODULE_NAMES`) and its cross-module imports pass the per-package rule in "Reviewing a new module".
- [ ] `mcp/` changes: `modules/<f>/{tools,service,helpers}.ts` layout as in `references/mcp-package.md`; `tools.ts` may import its own module's `ports`/`repository` (to build its repository + service from `container.client`/`container.resolver`, like `routes.ts` from `container.db`) and calls one service method — it never imports `adapters/` directly, nor another module's internals; only `messages.ts` writes model-facing error text; `cd mcp && npm test` (incl. `architecture.test.ts`) passes.
