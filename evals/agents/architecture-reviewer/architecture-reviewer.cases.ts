// strips Bash, so it cannot read the index. Without this preamble it stops with "nothing staged".

// The relative-paths line: smoke runs read the MAIN checkout by absolute path instead of cwd.
const review = (diff: string) => `Review the staged diff below. It is the complete output of \`git diff --cached\` — treat it as the staged diff; there is no other index to inspect. Bash is not available in this session, so you cannot run git or \`pnpm arch:check\`: list that under *Could not establish* and continue. The files the diff touches exist in the repo (pre-change version) if you need context. The repository root is the current working directory: use paths relative to it, never an absolute path to another checkout.
